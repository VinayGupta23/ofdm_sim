# ofdm_sim
A course project for Digital Communication that simulates the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technique. This program simulates a transmission of data over various channel models and analyses the error for different statistical channel estimation methods.


Toolboxes Used:
Communications, Signal Processing and the smoothening function from Curve Fitting Toolbox.
